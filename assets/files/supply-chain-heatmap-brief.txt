Supply Chain Heatmap - Enablement Brief
---------------------------------------
Purpose:
Deliver a unified view of carrier performance and distribution centre throughput to logistics leads.

Key elements:
- Shape maps blend dwell time, cost per route, and on-time percentage in a single glance.
- Metrics sourced from Azure Synapse pipelines with hourly refresh through Data Factory.
- Tooltip drillthrough exposes shipment-level commentary captured by regional teams.

How to use:
1. Review the Route Health overview to prioritise underperforming lanes.
2. Filter by carrier to compare reliability versus spend targets.
3. Export the "Exception List" table for weekly stand-up actions.
